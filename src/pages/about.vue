Kashmir Box is an inception of young thoughtful minds that went online to promote the traditional Heritage of Kashmir. Affected by the plight of local Kashmiri Artisans, the founders vowed to make a difference in the lives of thousands of Kashmiri Artisans and vouched in to create a global marketplace for them. The idea was, to bring the World to their Doorsteps! Gradually, the idea grew and took a beautiful form of taking Kashmir to the world by Creating the Brand Kashmir.

In a humble span of seven years, Kashmir Box has become unanimous with Kashmir. Kashmir Box has now become the marketplace for local artisans, craftsmen, producers and creative entrepreneurs who showcase their products to the world. We intend to create micro entrepreneurs out of these artisans, give them what they deserve, increase the employment in this field by increasing their wages and in turn improve their standard of living. Our artisans and partners get to sell their products by their own individual brand names, empowering then and giving them a sense of accomplishment and pride.
